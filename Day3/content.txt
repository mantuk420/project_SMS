Q. What is Python ??
- It is a programming language that is used to execute an algorithm
- It is widely used for backend, frontend, apps, games, Machine learning, deep learning, image procerssing, speech .....
- Written by Guido Van Roussum (Mathematician) in 1991


Q Why Python
- easy to understand
- no object declaration (int, float)
- no calling of void function
- no termination of code line with ;
- Open Source / free to use
- Vast collection of libraries...





Implementation of Python : 
Cython (.py)- Python was developed using C
Jython (.py)- Python was developed using Java
Ruby Python (.py)- Python was developed using Ruby
Iron Python (.ipy) - Python was developed using .net 
pypy (.py) - Python was developed using python

cpython - compiled python - byte code

.py - python
.ipynb - iron python notebook, interactive python notebook

object - everything that you declare is an object in python
	-	10 , 5.66 , False, "Hello", a, b, c, d

variable - used to store the value
	-	written on left side of =
	-	a b c d

literal - a value
	-	written on right side of =
	-	10 , 5.66 , False, "Hello"



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statistically typed language : 
	-	data type declaration of all objects are done explicitely (Externaly)
	-	Ex : int a = 10, float b = 3.66,char d = "Hello"
	-	To allocate the memory to the object (bytes)
	-	PL => C, Java ...
	
	-	On execution (Running) of the program, interpreter undertstands the datatype (referring to EXTERNAL command) of the object and allocate some defined memory to it.



Dynamically typed language : 
	-	data type declaration of all objects are done implicitely (Internaly)
	-	Ex : a = 10, b = 3.66,d = "Hello"
	-	PL => Python, R...

	-	On execution (Running) of the program, interpreter undertstands the datatype of the object and allocate some defined memory to it.


Python is known as Interpreted Language.


---------------------------------------------------------------
PYPI -> Python Package Index (Website)
	Find, install and publish Python packages with the Python Package Index on website (cloud)

PVM -> Python Virtual machine
	Interpreter that understands the Python code

PIP -> Python Installer Package (Hidden)
	This is used to install, uninstall, upgrade the package on local system


---------------------------------------------------------------



Python is slower to Java and C...
 - in Java , C because datatype declaration is done explicitely and it becomes easier for interpreter to work

Industry : 
Jupyter Notebook -> Analysis : Run selected lines
Anaconda , VS code


Python Files -> 
Anaconda (Spyder) , VS Code , Pycharm, Idle...


Anaconda Installations : 
[8gb ram, 10gb hdd (ssd), 1gb graphics (nvidea)]
https://www.anaconda.com/download
 
1. Anaconda Distribution (Earler : Anadonda Individual Edition)
2. pip/anaconda/conda you have to accept (It will become a part of environment variable)
	(pip as Path)
3. Register as Default Python + PIP to Path


-- After Installation
1. Start Menu -> Jupyter notebook -> Dialog Box (DONT CLOSE) -> Website (http://localhost:8888/tree)
	Problems -> If it didnot open in 5 minutes , copy the link from dialog box and use it in any browser
	Problem -> TOKEN problem, refer to token in URL 
		(http://localhost:8888/?token=8f0430de0b7f133db21a9f57dd9213a357ce28574a7146ec)


2. Start Menu -> Anaconda Navigator -> launch Jupyter Notebook (No Dialog box)


Jupyter Notebook -> opened in Google Colab -> Save the Files on drive/github/local system.
	Cons -> You have to install the packages again and again before running the file.
		if you want to save the package then limit is 15GB , as per drive...


Open Jupyter Notebook in any folder : 
https://www.drdataking.com/post/how-to-launch-jupyter-notebook-from-any-folder/




Create a file in Jupyter Notebook 
Homepage -> Click on the selected folder -> New -> Python



Jupyter Notebook tricks : 
Cursor is Blue when Outside (Cant be editted) [You can select multiple by using shift and arrows] ==> Press Excape
Cursor is Green when Inside (Edit) ==> Press Enter
Insert cell Above : a
Insert cell Below : b

Cell Type ==> Code (y) ==> Use it for scripting
Cell Type ==> markdown (m) ==> Use it for Texting


RUN -> Code -> 3 shortcuts
